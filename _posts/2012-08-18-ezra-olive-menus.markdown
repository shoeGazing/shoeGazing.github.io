We decided to try somewhere new for breakfast this morning and on my wife's suggestion headed over to [Ezra & Olive][1] on High St. 

It's an interesting little place, a big open space that also operates as a gallery and is open on weekends as a cafe. Pretty good food, reasonably priced and a lovely little outdoor area that we'll have to inspect a bit closer in the warmer months. 

One thing that really stood out for me was the&mdash;old hardcover Little Golden Books with the pages stripped out and replaced by the menu. A nifty little bit of bookmaking, taking advantage of the hard cover and original binding style to side stitch in the new content in a fairly seamless way. If I can source some old books cheaply I'd really like to give something like this a try for birthday invitations, or maybe find some bigger hardcovers to convert into notebook covers.

Ezra and Olive also hold weekly Life Drawing classes ($15 per session, all materials supplied). Definitely have to give this a try in a few weeks when there's a bit of a lull (hopefully) with work and uni.
