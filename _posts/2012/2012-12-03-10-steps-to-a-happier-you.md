LONDON: A spiritual teacher has suggested 10 simple steps that could lead you to a happier lifestyle.

Daniele Boido, author of *The Human Being Of The Future*, said purging negative emotions and improving relationships could helps us create a better and happier life, the *Daily Express* reported.

Here are his top tips on how to feel upbeat and fulfilled, as revealed by the *Daily Express* ---

### 1. Understand spirituality

To enhance your spirituality, make sure that whenever you come across someone with less understanding and awareness of particular situations you do everything in your power to help them.

"Show compassion, patience and unconditional love. Don't judge and instead share your knowledge and insights to try to support and encourage them to follow their own path," advises Boido.

"Work on becoming more aware and in tune with your thoughts and actions. This could be through meditation, exercise or a healthy lifestyle as these will help you to achieve inner strength and a connection to others," he adds.

### 2. Learn to forgive

He says holding on to past hurts only leads to a destructive state of mind.

"If someone has hurt you then you need to let go of your bitterness and resentment in order to move on," says Boido.

"For a few moments repeat in your mind or out loud, â€˜I truly and freely forgive and let go of any negative event and person from my past and anyone who needs to forgive me now does," he said.

### 3. Take care of your body

Boido recommends eating plenty of fresh foods including fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, pulses and wholegrains, suggesting "these will nourish your body with vibrant, healthy energy".

He also advocates taking up a mind and body exercise such as yoga, Pilates or tai chi.

### 4. Release negative emotions

To let go of negative emotions Boido suggests a simple exercise.

"Sitting comfortably, begin to inhale and exhale taking long, slow, deep breaths.

"As you exhale imagine releasing all negative emotions such as anger, revenge or jealousy. As you inhale imagine breathing in the positive qualities you need in your life such as calmness, courage and will power.

"Continue this for a few minutes. With practice you will find it easier to let go of negative feelings."

### 5. Share unconditional love

Boido says feeling unconditional love towards yourself and others creates harmony.

"The more you can open yourself up to this feeling, the more peaceful and tranquil you will feel," he states.

### 6. Find your inner boss

If one moment you feel calm and in control, yet the next stressed out and compelled to binge on chocolate, you might need to summon your inner boss.

"If you want to feel more in control, a simple tactic is to imagine that you have an inner chairman," says Boido.

### 7. Learn from others

Boido says we can learn a lot from people we fall in love with.

### 8. Quiet time

When you're caught up with work, looking after family or just trying to get through the day it's easy to slip into an automatic, zombie-like state. To come out of this Boido says, "Find a quiet place. Relax and starting with your right thumb mentally isolate and focus on every single body part. "Notice how they feel and work on being aware of how you are mentally and physically," he suggests.

### 9. Create positive vibes

"You must develop the ability to focus," says Boido.

He suggests practicing this exercise: "Draw a large circle. Fill it with black pen. Place it at eye level, breathing slowly and deeply. Focus on it for three minutes. Use these focusing skills when summoning positive thoughts."

### 10. Try to connect with nature

"In the morning spend two to three minutes focusing on things such as water (rain), trees, flowers, grass or fruits. In the evening focus on inner qualities including love, peace, kindness and harmony. This will help you to create a stronger connection to these natural qualities and feel more in tune with nature," Boido says. --- *Agencies*
