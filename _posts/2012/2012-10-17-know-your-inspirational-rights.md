You have the right to be you --- the way you are --- the way you want to be.

You have the right to grow, to change, to become, to strive, to reach for any goal.

You have the right to be limited only by your degree of talent and amount of effort.

You have the right to privacy --- in marriage, family, or any relationship or group.

You have the right to keep a part of your life secret, no matter how trivial or important: merely because you want it to be that way.

You have the right to be alone part of the each day, each week and each year to spend time with and on yourself.

You have the right to be loved and to love, to be accepted, cared for, adored, and to fulfil that privilege.

You have the right to ask questions of anyone at anytime in any matter that effects your life, so long as it is your business to do so, and to be listened to and taken seriously.

You have the right to self-respect and to do everything you need to do to increase your self-esteem, so long as you hurt no one in doing so.

You have the right to be happy, to find something in the world that is meaningful and rewarding to you and that gives you a sense of completeness. You have the right to be trusted, to trust and to be taken at your word. You have the right to be given a chance to make it good if possible, if you are wrong. You have the right to change your mind.

You have the right to be free as long as you act responsibly and are mindful of the rights of others and of those obligations that you entered into freely.

You have the right to win, to succeed, to complete, to make plans and to see those plans fulfilled. You have the right to become the best you can possibly become. You have the right to boundaries and limits, as well as to be intentional, and to choices.
