I've recently taken a new role where I'm responsible for a team of 9 web application and user interface developers and designers. For our first meetup I wanted to do something a bit special, so in addition to catering a couple dozen of [Nigella Lawson's never fail cupcakes][1], I made everyone in the team personalised magnetic name plates from wooden scrabble tiles. 

The tiles themselves were relatively cheap to source from ebay, and the construction was pretty straight forward (though varnishing the tiles and squeezing them into my too-narrow packaging was moderately fiddly), but overall I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.

Now, I just need to figure out what to do with the 150 odd leftover tiles&hellip;
