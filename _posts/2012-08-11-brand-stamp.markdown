I came to the conclusion a few months ago that trying trying to come up with a good name for my business was a bit like trying to recall an elusive memory&mdash;the harder you try, the more difficult it becomes, and it's usually only when you let go of it and think about something else that it comes to you.

So I decided to give myself a break, and instead I worked up a personal brandmark to go with my online <em>dlimiter</em> identity. As a bit of a novelty, I ordered a complimentary ink stamp from [Simon's Stamps][1] to use with mailed orders, client gifts and stuff.

The stamp arrived yesterday. After some mad dashing around trying to source a half decent inkpad, I finally got to test it out. All in all, I think it turned out pretty well.
