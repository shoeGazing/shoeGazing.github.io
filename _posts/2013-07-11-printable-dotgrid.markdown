For some time now I've been keeping my eyes open for a source of relatively cheap A4 dot ruled pads in Melbourne for general design and wireframing.

Behance offer a nice [hardcover ring bound dot pad][1], but at $15 plus postage it's a little expensive for daily use. I also quite like the [Rhodia dot pads][2] (around $10), available locally, but in my (admittedly anecdotal experience) a bit hard to find in a pinch.
  
While searching I also came across a variety of nice printable paper options, including Ben Martineau's nice [Grids For Sketching][3] set and the big archive at [Printable Paper][4]. I couldn't find quite the setup I was looking for, so I made my own, and figured I might as well share it.

The file is a PDF, 5mm dot ruled A4 grid in 40% black, free for personal and commercial use. To print make sure that scaling is set to 100% in your print dialog (otherwise you'll end up with a 4.Xmm grid when the page is scaled down to allow for the paper feed).
