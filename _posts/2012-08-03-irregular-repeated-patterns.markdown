Its a new semester at RMIT and I've just started an illustration class taught by the talented [Eirian Chapman][1]. For the first class workshop we went through a nifty method to produce repeated irregular patterns and I thought I'd share it here. 

It's a fairly straight forward 4 step process: 
* **Step 1**: Start with a square canvas (it has to be completely square as you will be quartering and rearranging it). Draw the first part of your image in the centre of the sheet, being careful no to cross or touch the sides. (Try and make sure that any lines and colouring is complete before moving to the next step, as it will be really difficult to get them consistent after you have quartered the image)
* **Step 2**: Halve the image vertically, and flip the edges (if you're using real paper, just tape up the flipped halves with masking tape)
* **Step 3**: Halve the image horizontally and flip the edges. Now you should have a square with your original image distributed to the 4 corners of the sheet, and some open space in the centre.
* **Step 4**: Fill the new space in the centre of the tile, once again without touching the edges of the canvas.

<img alt="repeated_pattern_step_2" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/repeated_pattern-02.png" width="160" height="160" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0"/>
<img alt="repeated_pattern_step_3" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/repeated_pattern-03.png" width="160" height="160" style="margin:1em 0"/>
<img alt="repeated_pattern_step_4" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/repeated_pattern-04.png" width="160" height="160" style="margin:1em 0 1em 1em"/>


And that's it, you should now have a nicely repeatable pattern tile. 

You can get some really beautiful effects with traditional media, but if you're just starting out it's probably easier to digitally produce the content as it makes it much easier to get a good alignment and clean join when rearranging the quarters and tiling.   

As an example below you can see the the finished tile I made (110GSM cartridge paper and a cheap 0.4mm Artline writing pen) and a digitally coloured version of the resulting pattern:

<img alt="example_tile" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/example_tile.jpg" width="300" height="300" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0" /> 

<img alt="example_pattern" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/example_pattern.jpg" width="360" height="300" style="margin:1em 0 1em 1em" />
