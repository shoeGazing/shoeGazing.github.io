For people whose registrars don't provide DNS (Domain Name System) hosting with domain registration then here's the list who offers it free of charge.

All of these providers are either free, or have a decent free plan.

A highly reputable domain registrar Namecheap offers free DNS hosting package, you don't even have to register your domain with them (though we use them for domain registration!)
