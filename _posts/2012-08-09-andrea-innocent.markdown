Had a really interesting guest lecture this week at Uni with Illustrator [Andrea Innocent][1]. She talked a bit about her background and time in Japan and its influence on her style, as well as walking through her process and answering questions about pricing and licensing.

I thought her work was just beautiful&mdash;the style and sensibility of the Japan influenced prints particularly resonating with me.
