excerpt: "No matter who tries to teach you lessons about life, you won't understand it until you have to go through them on your own."
---

* Don't go for looks, they can deceive. Don't go for wealth even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile.
* There are moments in life when you really miss someone that you want to pick them up from your dreams and hug them. Hope you dream of that someone.
* Dream what you want to dream, go where you want to go, be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want in life.
* When one door of happiness closes, another opens. But we often took so long at the closed door, that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.
* The best kind of friend is the one you could sit on a porch, swing with, never saying a word and then walk away feeling like that was the best conversation you've had.
* It's true that we don't know what we've goat until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.
* Always put yourself in other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably does hurt the person too.
* The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves and not to twist them with our own image, otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.
* The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes along the way.
* Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we should know how to be grateful for that gift.
