As we grow older, we lose appreciation for little things that add happiness in our lives. Here is a list of little things in life to cherish.

* Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
* Memorise your favourite poem.
* Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.
* When you say, "I love you", mean it.
* When you say, "I'm sorry", look the person in the eye.
* Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
* Believe in love at first sight.
* Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.
* Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.
* In disagreements, fight fairly. No name-calling.
* Don't judge people by their relatives.
* Talk slowly but think quickly.
* When someone asks a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"
* Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
* Call your mum.
* Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.
* When you lose, don't lose the lesson.
* Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; Responsibility for all your actions.
* Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.
* When you realise you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.
* Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice.
* Marry a man/woman you loves to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.
* Spend some time alone.
* Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.
* Remember that silence is something the best answer.
* Read more books and watch less TV.
* Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back you'll get to enjoy it a second time.
* Trust in God but lock your car.
* A loving atmosphere in your home is so important. Do all you can to create a tranquil harmonious home.
