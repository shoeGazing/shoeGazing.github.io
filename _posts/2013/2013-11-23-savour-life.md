Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others, it is because we are different that each of us is special.

Don't set your goals by what other people deem important, only you know what is best for you.

Don't take for granted the things closest to your heart, cling to that as you would your life, for without them life is meaningless.

Don't let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or the future.

By living your life one day at a time, you live all the days of your life.

Don't give up when you still have something to give, nothing is really over... until the moment you stop trying.

Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect, it is the fragile thread that binds us to each other.

Don't be afraid to encounter risks, it is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.

Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find. The quickest way to receive love is to give love.

The fastest way to keep love is to hold on too tightly, and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.

Don't dismiss your 'dreams'. To be without dreams is to be without hope. To be without hope is to be without purpose.

Don't run through life so fast that you forget where you've been, but also know where you're going.

Life is not a race, but a journey to be savoured every step of the way.
