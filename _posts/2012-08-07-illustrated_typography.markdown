This week in my [Illustration class][1] we looked at illustrated typography, with some beautiful examples by [Stefan Sagmeister][2], [Jessica Hische][3], [Mike Perry][4], [Deanne Cheuk][7], [Marian Bantjes][6], and [Emily Forgot][5].

As an exercise, we were asked to illustrate an ampersand based on a selection of random magazine images. I managed a couple of examples with a vaguely art nouveau sensibility: one based on a fish, the other on two fighting turkeys (I have to admit, that's a sentence I never thought I'd utter). Originals were sketched by hand and inked with Copic Multiliner brush pen, then scanned and some simple flat colour applied digitally. 

<img alt="inked_ampersands" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/ampersands.png" width="400" height="300" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0"/>
<img alt="coloured_ampersands" src="{{ site.url}}/img/posts/ampersands_colour.jpg" width="260" height="300" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0"/>

In addition to the worthies listed above, if you're at all interested in hand drawn type you should also check out [Dana Tanamachi's][8] stunning chalk work and the beautiful hand lettering of [Mary Kate McDevitt][9].
